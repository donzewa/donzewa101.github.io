Donna's Projects



Project #1
SIEM Alerts and Results Project:


 
Azure Sentinel(SIEM) is connected to a live virtual machine, in which it is then acting as a honey pot. I was able to see live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from various places around the globe. Then I was able to use a formated PowerShell Script to find the attackers Geolocation, and datalize it into the Azure Sentintel Map.

-The following 2 pictures below is the Custom Security Log Code to develop the azure sentinel VM logs and results

The folliwng 4 pictures are on the Microsoft Sentinel page of the Scheduled Alerts for login: Medium to High depeding if activity is done by authorized user or not. The pcitures show the detailed info for each schedule login.

Project #2
Active Directory Project

Basic Overview Chart

![Map of Active Directory VM users set up](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73c2837b-c5b4-409b-b852-d8780db77acd)

Step 1: I Downloaded and installed Oracle Virtual Box: use to run my virtual machine

![Screenshot 2024-11-09 184939](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc76784-ec5d-48b1-9f90-3032b9f7aa02)

![Screenshot 2024-11-09 185449](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a2da910-3403-4e4f-8dc1-d123038c2ac2)


Step 2: I Downloaded and installed Windows 10 ISO and Server 2019 ISO: these both used to install 2 separate virtual machines.

![Screenshot 2024-11-09 185002](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c9e758d-cfa4-4228-8940-4d8d612ca16e)

Step 3: I Createed 1st virtual machine(domain controller): houseâ€™s the active directory

![DC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ab31b4b-c4b3-4ce4-b8ee-6ed4b1fdb2a1)

Step 4: I Gave 1st virtual machine 2 separate network adapter: 1st adapter connects to outside internet, 2nd one to connect to virtual box(private network for clients).

![Screenshot 2024-11-09 185308](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c9449ea-7a1a-43a4-8f26-db74d01ea372)

Step 5: I Installed Server 2019: assign IP address for internal network, external network gets automatic IP addressing.

Step 6: I named the server, installed active directory and create domain: configure NAT and routing (so client on private network can reach the domain controller) **Following shows configuring the Active directory into VM and Domain name.

The following shows how my Server Dashboard: including all the roles and server groups I configured together.

Step 7: I Installed DHCP on domain controller (for windows 10 to get automatic IP addressing)

![Screenshot 2024-11-09 191024](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e688865c-282e-4af1-9059-50de286aa032)

Step 8: On domain controller I ran a powershell script in order to automatically create 1,000 users on active directory

The following 2 photos shows the file I used to house all the users and powershell script

Step 10: I Created another virtual machine: by installing windows 10 on it. This virtual machine connected to private virtual network. I Named it client 1, joined it to the domain. And I log into it with domain account
